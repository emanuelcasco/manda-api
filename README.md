# Manda API (WIP)

API to download manga from [Manga Reader](http://www.mangareader.net), save in PDF format and sent to your e-mail.

## First steps

#### Installing node
Get the latest version of node from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/) or using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
Nvm approach is preferred.

#### Getting dependencies
Run ```npm install``` or ```yarn``` from rootpath of the project.


#### Starting your app
Now, to start your app run ```npm start``` in the rootpath of the project. Then access your app at **localhost:port**. The port is logged in the console where you ran the start script.

## Development

#### Environments
By default, the environment will be **development**, but you can easily change it using the **NODE_ENV** environmental variable.

#### Environment variables
`Dotenv` is used for managing environment variables. They are stored in the `/.env` file. Take into account that the variables defined in the `bashrc` are not overrided.

The environment variables should be added to the `.env` file in the form of `NAME=VALUE`, as the following example:
```
NODE_MAILER_SERVICE
NODE_MAILER_USER
NODE_MAILER_PASS
NODE_MAILER_RECEIPIENT
NODE_API_SESSION_SECRET
NODE_REDIS_URL
```

**Remember not to push nor commit the `.env` file.**
